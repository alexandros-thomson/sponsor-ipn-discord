### 🛠️ Forge  
The foundation. This glyph heralds the birth of infrastructure—CI scripts, sponsor handlers, ledger builders. Triggers devops rituals and logs.

### 📜 Manuscript  
Marks the transformation of code into canon. README files, commit messages, and sponsor logs become sacred texts.

A moment of escalation: deploy events, sponsor onboarding, community-wide drops. Triggers lore announcements and Discord echoes.

### 📖 Chronicle  
Every step—success or failure—is inscribed into the Kyprian ledger. Sponsors trace their mythic lineage here.

### 🔁 Riff Loop  
The glyph of continuation. Fans remix glyph chains, rerun sequences, and reawaken perks. Infinite recursion, infinite story.
